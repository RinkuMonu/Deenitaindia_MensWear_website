    (Jajam Block Prints)
    <br />
    At Jajam Block Prints, we value your trust and aim to provide you with authentic hand-block printed textiles crafted with care. 
    Since our products are handmade, minor variations in print, weave, or color are natural and reflect the beauty of handcrafted work, not defects.
    <br />
    However, we do provide options for return, refund, or exchange under the following conditions:
  </p>

  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#393838]">1. Replacement / Refund for Defective or Incorrect Products</h3>
  <p className="text-justify text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    If you receive a defective or incorrect product, please notify us within 48 hours of delivery by emailing 
    <a href="mailto:shreeshyamblockprints.1@gmail.com" className="text-blue-600"> shreeshyamblockprints.1@gmail.com</a>.
    The product must be returned within 7 days of delivery. Once received and inspected, we will issue either a replacement (if available) or a refund as per your preference.
  </p>
  <p className="text-justify text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    <strong>Return Conditions:</strong> Products must be unused, unworn, unwashed, and undamaged. 
    They must be returned with the original invoice, packaging, labels, tags, and any accessories. 
    If the returned product does not meet these conditions (e.g., used, washed, altered, or damaged), the return will be rejected.
  </p>

  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#393838]">2. Refund Process</h3>
  <p className="text-justify text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    Refunds will be issued to the original payment method used at purchase. 
    Please allow 7–14 working days for the amount to reflect in your account, depending on your payment provider. 
    If replacement stock is unavailable, we will provide either store credit or a full refund.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p className="text-justify text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
